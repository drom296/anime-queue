- on anime view page: figure out how to check to see if the page failed to load.
- on anime view page: defect - refreshing the page pushes the episode count forward
	-> one way to fix this is to add something to the scope on the queue page,
	then clear it on view page. This way the view page can look for that variable
	and decide if it should increment
