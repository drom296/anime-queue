# anime-queue
Moving past bookmarks, my Anime Queue.

I tend to watch a lot of anime that isn't hosted by Netflix or Hulu. This means that instead of a nice queue, that both aforementioned services offer, I have to manually keep track of where I'm at via bookmarks.

NO MORE!
I got tired of making sure I updated bookmarks each time I finished a single 20min episode (too much work). Instead I thought about creating an overlay, and having a few buttons to advance me through my favorite shows; having it keep track of my last watched episode.

Welcome to the Anime Queue.


P.S. I still have to figure out the legality of what I'm doing, but for now I'm just focusing on functionality and experience.


I have moved the tracking of later tasks/bugs to trello - https://trello.com/b/apv6hEfU/anime-queue
