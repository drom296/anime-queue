I'm a little worried about the authentication scheme I'm following. It looks like it's making a common space for all
users, with users having singular items in this space. This is different from what I want to do. I want each user to
have their own space, and that they can only see their own items. I'm going to continue this to the end, and then decide
what I'll need to tweak to have user spaces.
