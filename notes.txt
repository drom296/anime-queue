I GOT AUTH WORKING! I messed up on the initialization of the Nav Ctrl, and was logging out with each page load. I fixed
that issue, and then added auth to the Queue page...and it's working! Now I just have to add it to all the other anime
endpoints.
Finished. Everything on the anime side looks to be authenticated. I might have to do some user tasks, like changing a
password, or recovering a password.

Figure out what's going on with the logIN. It looks like the API calls are succeeding, but it's not pulling something
back correctly and it seems, from the UI, that you're not logged in.

I'm a little worried about the authentication scheme I'm following. It looks like it's making a common space for all
users, with users having singular items in this space. This is different from what I want to do. I want each user to
have their own space, and that they can only see their own items. I'm going to continue this to the end, and then decide
what I'll need to tweak to have user spaces.
Currently, my document is the list of anime. My initial thoughts is that my document should change to be a User. This
user would then have the list of anime, as well as any user info.
